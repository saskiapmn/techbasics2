Hi, this is Saskia Proßmann and this is my TechBasics II Exam project.

You will be able to find in this repository: 

my python code, which you will for running the application, 
my pictures, necessary for making the GUI look like JobWave,
my report, containing all the necessary information on how this application came to be
and a README.file.

JobWave
Introduction

Currently, employers who are looking for cheap and flexible labor, as well as people who can multi-task and act responsibly, are met with an increasing supply of university students who are looking into the part-time market and are having to work due to financial necessity (Curtis & Lucas, 2001) as housing prices in many cities in Germany are ever more increasing (I am Expat 2022). Younger generations, also called Gen Z, have clear ideas about what they desire in a job. Many want flexibility, variety but also diversity within their work life (Link Humans 2022).

For a lot of students, flexible part-time work is a way of experiencing the workforce and gaining valuable skills for their future work life (The Learning Network, 2022). Therefore, I decided to create this website, where students can look for new different part-time jobs from week to week. They fill in for sick employees or employees who are on vacation but do not have to make a long-term commitment to a company or shop.  If they liked that employer they can decide to come back and maybe work there permanently or, if they were not as content with their employer, they do not have to come back since they did not sign a permanent contract and have therefore gained a valuable experience. Because even knowing what kind of job you like, and what you don’t like can be a helpful tool in the future.

The website targets specifically organizations and places, where they have a short-term demand, for example, if another worker gets sick and the employer needs a student to take over the shift for a few days. This app particularly wants to focus on jobs in the catering and service industry.
